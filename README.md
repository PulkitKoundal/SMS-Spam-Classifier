# SMS Spam Classifier 

This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam using text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and the Naive Bayes algorithm.


##  Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled SMS messages, categorized as either `spam` or `ham` (not spam).


##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)
- Scikit-learn (for ML model and evaluation)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
